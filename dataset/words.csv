Antarctica
is
the
southernmost
continent
on
Earth
but
it
is
not
actually
a
country
Since
there
is
not
a
single
government
in
charge
of
Antarctica
it
is
protected
by
a
treaty
signed
by
many
other
countries
Those
countries
have
agreed
to
peacefully
protect
this
amazing
piece
of
land
for
scientific
discovery
This
is
part
of
the
reason
why
Antarctica
has
been
such
an
exciting
territory
for
geographic
exploration
Antarctica
is
a
land
of
extremes
It
has
the
highest
elevation
the
coldest
temperatures
and
the
most
ice
out
of
any
other
location
on
earth
Ice
sheets
and
glaciers
cover
the
territory
and
despite
this
Antarctica
is
still
considered
a
cold
dry
desert
One
hundred
years
ago
there
were
many
expeditions
led
by
adventurous
explorers
to
learn
more
about
what
Antarctica
had
to
offer
This
period
became
known
as
the
Heroic
Era
of
Antarctic
Exploration
One
of
the
most
famous
Antarctic
explorers
was
named
Ernest
Shackleton
He
led
three
separate
expeditions
to
Antarctica
Shackleton
set
several
records
for
exploration
during
the
height
of
his
career
including
being
one
of
the
first
people
to
drive
a
car
in
Antarctica
Shackleton
was
not
only
known
for
his
bravery
but
for
his
courageous
leadership
too
On
his
most
famous
expedition
Shackleton
led
his
crew
on
a
ship
called
the
Endurance
It
eventually
became
trapped
in
ice
remaining
stuck
for
more
than
a
year
When
Shackleton
realized
the
extent
of
the
damage
he
ordered
his
crew
to
abandon
the
ship
pile
into
lifeboats
and
seek
safety
The
ship
eventually
sank
But
all
twenty
seven
people
in
his
crew
were
saved
thanks
to
his
ability
to
make
good
decisions
under
pressure
While
this
ship
was
lost
to
history
for
many
years
it
was
found
just
last
year
in
another
Antarctic
exploration
New
tools
like
data
collecting
robots
helped
the
ship
be
discovered
Even
though
Shackleton
paved
the
way
for
much
of
what
we
know
about
Antarctica
today
we
still
have
much
to
learn
about
this
fascinating
environment
